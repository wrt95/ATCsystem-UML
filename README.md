# Air Traffic Control System

This is the Coursework for F28SD Software Design, 2nd year of Bsc Computer Science.

This is a portfolio containing different diagrams using UML, to design the ATC system at an airport. This is my version of it.

The source code for this program has been encrypted in ATCsystem.zip due to the coursework being still used. 

If you want to have a look at the code, password can be requested from wrt_95@hotmail.com.
